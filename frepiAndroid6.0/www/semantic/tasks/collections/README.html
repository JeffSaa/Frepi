<p>These are collections of tasks that are imported together.</p>

<p>To import them into gulp:
```javascript
var
  gulp    = require('gulp'),
  // modified to point to semantic folder
  install = require('tasks/collections/install')
;
gulp = install(gulp);</p>

<p>// tasks are now injected and ready to be used
gulp.start('install');
```</p>
